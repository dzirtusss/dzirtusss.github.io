One small app I really enjoy recently is [Turbo Boost Switcher for OSX](https://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/). It silently sits in tray
and disables Intel's Turbo Boost CPU feature.

But hey, why would anyone wanted to do this?
1. to keep temperature low and fan low/stopped
2. to save battery life

Tradeoffs?

1. some performance decrease in performance heavy moments

However, from my expirience, those performance heavy moments happen quite rarely in my
daily work (kinda bundles recompile), and this is generally unnoticable (maybe ~10% less). But stable low temperature in 40-50C range and "fan-off" I like very much.
Maybe battery life as well, but I rarely deplete it so never measured.
